Which Package to use

.. note::
   For previous versions of TYPO3 (from 4.4 to 6.1), the user had the
   choice between several "Packages" to download (Introduction,
   Government, Blank). Since TYPO3 version 6.2, this concept was
   changed. There is only one TYPO3 Package ("TYPO3 Source"),
   with which the user is able to install an empty installation.
   During Installation, the user then gets the chance to load additional
   "Distributions" to kick start with some out-of-the-box working
   environment.

An overview of all available packages and versions (also older still
supported releases) can be found at
`http://typo3.org/download/ <http://typo3.org/download/>`_.

Which File Format to use
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The TYPO3 Source package is available as a :file:`.zip` or
:file:`.tar.gz` distribution. Their content is the same and you should
download the one that you will be able to extract directly on your
webserver.

For more information on the different distributions see the section
:ref:`the-distributions-in-detail`.
