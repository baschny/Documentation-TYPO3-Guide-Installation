The Install Tool
================

#. Hit the start page of your freshly created site with your browser
   and the Install Tool will open in the so called "1-2-3 mode",
   which will guide you through the steps for installing TYPO3 for the
   first time
   (`http://www.example.com/typo3/install/ <http://www.example.com/typo3/install/>`_).

#. This is what you should see:

      :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, first step.

#. In case you have some problems in your Environment, you will get
   warnings or hints in this screen. In this case, you should try to
   fix it.

#. *Enter your database credentials.* Enter MySQL username and password.
   In most cases the database host is "localhost".

#. *Create a new database for TYPO3 or use an existing empty
   database.*:

      :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, third step.

#. Enter an username and password for your first admin user. This
   password will also be configured for the Install Tool. The "site
   name" will identify this installation (in the page tree and browser
   title).

#. In the last step you will get the choice to download and install
   an existing distribution after first login. If you want to start
   with a clean package, untick this checkbox.

#. *The basic installation is now complete!*

After you finished the basic installation procedure, TYPO3 is working
and the most appropriate settings will have been made for you. You
will get redirected to the Backend and can login.

If you later want to make changes to your installation settings,
use the "Install Tool". You can find more information in the section
"In-Depth Installation", subsection ":ref:`the-install-tool-in-depth`"
below.
