The Install Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Install Tool provides tools around maintainance of your
installation: Upgrading, checking system environment, configuring
settings from `$TYPO3_CONF_VARS` and solving problems. It's usage is
not dependent of a working Backend, and you login with it using a
single password.

First go to your site and enter the install tool (
`http://www.example.com/typo3/install
<http://www.example.com/typo3/install>`_ ).

(If you see a message "The Install Tool is locked", create a new file
named "ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL" in the folder typo3conf/. Then reload the
page.)

Here you can configure *all* installation options concerning your TYPO3
installation. We suggest you go through the whole list and read the
description of the settings carefully at least once, so you get an
impression of what you can configure. Normally you can, but you don't
have to change anything here during installation as the steps before
already took care of the most important settings.

Upgrade wizard

You don't need the upgrade wizard while *installing* TYPO3. It will be
explained in a later chapter about upgrading TYPO3.
